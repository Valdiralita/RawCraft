1. You have to include your own textures and fonts.
	Place the terrain.png inside the .\RawCraft\RawCraftContent\ folder.
2. For best minecraft experience download this font: 
	http://www.fonts2u.com/minecraft-regular.font
	If you want to select another font, just install it and edit the "<FontName>" inside of the .spritefont files.
